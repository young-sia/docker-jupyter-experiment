# docker-jupyter-experiment: gathering data from twitter

## This project is gathering data from Twitter using Dockers,SQL, and python.

### The topic of this project is "What is the most used website in twitter?: Data Science"

I made a pipeline to gather twitter conversations. Especially, I divided websites 
to make it useful enough to figure out which website is mostly used.
